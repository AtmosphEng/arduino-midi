# Arduino MIDI Library

Quite some time ago, I spent some effort to add Midi support to the [Arduino-STK](https://github.com/pschatzmann/Arduino-STK.git) library.
In the meantime I came to the conclusion that it would be better to have this as a separate functionality, so that it could be used by other 
of my projects.

The library supports

- Midi over an Arduino Streams (e.g. Serial)
- Midi over TCP/IP
- Midi over Bluetooth
- Midi over BLE


Please note that most of the examples that generate sound are based on __Arduino-STK__!

### Documentation

- Here is the generated [Class Documentation](https://pschatzmann.github.io/arduino-midi/html/annotated.html). 

### Installation in Arduino

You can download the library as zip and call include Library -> zip library. Or you can git clone this project into the Arduino libraries folder e.g. with

```
cd  ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
git clone pschatzmann/arduino-midi.git

```
